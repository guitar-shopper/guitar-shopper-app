# GuitarShopper

Guitar Shopper is an e-commerce web app for a fictional guitar retailer. It's my first full stack web app, so there's certainly room for improvement, but overall I'm happy with how it turned out.

This project was built over the course of 4 days for the 'Grace Shopper' portion of Fullstack Academy's software engineering curriculum. The assignment was to build a fully-functional e-commerce app. Beyond that, our team had full creative control.

I worked on a three person team, with Matthew Snow (@Msnow90) and Mikhail Qader (@mhq2101). Big thanks to the Fullstack engineering team for providing 'Bones,' the boilerplate on which GuitarShopper was written. 

# Overall Comments
Things I like:
  - How the guitars are laid out on the homepage.
  - The checkbox filtering functionality.
  - Local and OAuth login.
  - Cart functionality.
  - All brands page and individual brands pages.
  - The picture of the rolling stones by Ethan Russell.

Things I don't like:
- We didn't follow 'best practices' well enough. More specifically, I would've liked to have seen clearer, more professional git commit messages, and a more uniform coding style throughout. 
- We left styling for last, which meant that we ended up running out of time for some styling features.
    - Sidebar, while functional, looks like it was just scrapped together.
    - Cart page and single guitar page look sloppy/uneven.
- Not a single test!!!!!!

# Conclusion
I had a great time building this project. Even though we didn't get as far as I would've liked, I loved working with Snow and Mikhail. I couldn't have asked for a better team dynamic, and I hope I have the opportunity to work with them in the future.

Thanks for checking out our repo!
